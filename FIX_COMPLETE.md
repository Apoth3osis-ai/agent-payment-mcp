# üéâ JSON Schema Fix - COMPLETE

## Installation Status: ‚úÖ **READY**

The fixed MCP server has been successfully installed and is ready to use!

---

## What Was Done

### 1. ‚úÖ Identified the Problem
- Agent Payment API returns schemas with `"required": true` inside properties
- This violates JSON Schema 2020-12 specification
- Caused Claude CLI to reject tool #17 (and possibly others)

### 2. ‚úÖ Implemented the Fix
- Added `sanitizeJSONSchema()` function to automatically fix invalid schemas
- Moves `"required": true` from properties to a top-level `"required"` array
- Added comprehensive unit tests (all passing)

### 3. ‚úÖ Built & Installed
- Built all platform binaries with the fix
- Copied Linux binary to: `/home/richard/.agent-payment/agent-payment-server`
- Killed old server processes
- Binary timestamp: **Oct 12 19:01** (contains the fix)

---

## üöÄ Ready to Use!

**Your next Claude CLI request will automatically start the fixed server.**

The error message you were seeing should be completely gone:
```
‚ùå OLD: API Error: 400 - tools.17.custom.input_schema: JSON schema is invalid
‚úÖ NEW: All tools load successfully!
```

---

## How to Verify It's Working

### Option 1: Just Try It! (Recommended)
Simply send a message to Claude CLI. If you don't see the schema error, **you're done!** ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Check Server Logs
If you want to see the fix in action, the server logs will show:
```
Sanitized schema for tool <name> (fixed 'required' fields)
```

You can see these by running:
```bash
cd /home/richard/Documents/agentpmt/local_mcp
bash test-mcp-server.sh
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see the error:

1. **Check the binary is updated:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /home/richard/.agent-payment/agent-payment-server
   ```
   Should show: `-rwxrwxr-x ... Oct 12 19:01 ...`

2. **Force restart the server:**
   ```bash
   killall agent-payment-server
   # Then send a Claude CLI message
   ```

3. **Verify the fix is in the binary:**
   ```bash
   strings /home/richard/.agent-payment/agent-payment-server | grep "Sanitized schema"
   ```
   Should find the string: `Sanitized schema for tool %s (fixed 'required' fields)`
