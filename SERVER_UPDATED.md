# ✅ MCP Server Updated - What You Need to Know

## Status: **FIXED AND INSTALLED** ✅

The updated MCP server binary with JSON Schema sanitization has been:
- ✅ Built successfully
- ✅ Installed to `/home/richard/.agent-payment/agent-payment-server`
- ✅ Old server processes killed
- ✅ Ready to use

## What Changed

The MCP server now automatically fixes invalid JSON schemas from the Agent Payment API by:
1. Detecting `"required": true` inside property definitions
2. Removing them (they're invalid in JSON Schema 2020-12)
3. Moving required fields to a proper top-level `"required"` array

## Next Step: Test with Claude CLI

**Simply send a new message to Claude CLI** - it will automatically start the new server.

The error message you were seeing:
```
API Error: 400 - tools.17.custom.input_schema: JSON schema is invalid
```

Should now be **GONE**! 🎉

## Verification

When the server starts, you should see log messages like:
```
Sanitized schema for tool <tool-name> (fixed 'required' fields)
```

This confirms the fix is working.

## If You Still See The Error

1. **Make sure the server restarted:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep agent-payment-server
   ```
   You should see a process started AFTER 19:01 (when we copied the new binary)

2. **Check the binary timestamp:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh /home/richard/.agent-payment/agent-payment-server
   ```
   Should show: `Oct 12 19:01`

3. **Manually kill and restart:**
   ```bash
   killall agent-payment-server
   # Then send a message to Claude CLI - it will auto-restart
   ```

## Optional: Manual Test

To see the server logs and verify the fix is working:

```bash
cd /home/richard/Documents/agentpmt/local_mcp
bash test-mcp-server.sh
```

This will show you the server startup logs including schema sanitization messages.

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

Before (❌ Invalid):
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "field": {
      "type": "string",
      "required": true  ← INVALID!
    }
  }
}
```

After (✅ Valid):
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "field": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["field"]  ← CORRECT!
}
```

## Summary

🎯 **Action Required**: Just use Claude CLI normally - the fix is already in place!

💡 **Expected Result**: No more JSON schema errors
